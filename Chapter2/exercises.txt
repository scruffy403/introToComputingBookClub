Exercise 2.1:
According to the Guinnes Book of World Records, the longest word in the
English language is floccinaucinihilipilification, meaning "the act or habit
of describing or regarding something as worthless".This word was reputedly
invented by a non-hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobic student at Eton who
combined four words in his Latin textbook.Prove Guiness wrong by identifying a
longer english word. An English speaker (familiar with
floccinaucinihilipilification and the morphemes you use) should be able to
deduce the meaning of your word. 

My response:

If by identifying the author means simply finding an English word that is
longer than floccinaucinihilipilification (29 letters), then the word
pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism is longer (30 letters). I believe this word has
5 morphemes, pseudo, hypo, para, thyroid, ism. I would expect a user who could
work out the definition of the former word should also be able to work out the
definition of the latter.

If the author intends for the reader to themselves construct a word that is
longer than I would need longer to attempt that. "Identifying" is a perhaps a
bit vague in the context. Language is ambigious.
